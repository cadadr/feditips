# Göktuğ's [\#FediTips](https://toot.cat/tags/FediTips) No. 001 (Bio and pinned toots)

Want to write a bio but don't know what to put in there? Here are a few
ideas to make a friendly bio.

  - Say "hi\!", and tell us how you'd like us to refer to you. Your name
    or pseudonym / nickname, and your pronouns, if you have a
    preference.

  - Tell us which languages you'd like to use.

  - Share links to your website(s), if it's fine for you to have that
    info publically available. If you account is pseudonymous tho, make
    sure that such links does not compromise your real identity, because
    there's no undo button.

  - Include the hashtag [\#nobot](https://toot.cat/tags/nobot)
    because... IDK, I've seen people use it, and I haven't had follows
    from respectful bots since then, so I feel like it works.

  - If your account is locked, tell us if you are open to follow
    requests, and any criteria you have and want to share for approving
    them.

You can also pin toots on your profile, which will show up at the top of
the list of your toots. Here are a few ideas regarding what to include
there.

  - A toot with image descriptions of your profile pic and header image.
    This will help visually impaired people to know what they look like.

  - An [\#introduction](https://toot.cat/tags/introduction) post\! It's
    the toot where you explain yourself with a bit more detail (if you
    wish to, of course). What you do, your hobbies, interests, whatever.

Examples for each of these can be found in my profile, so feel free to
check.
