# Göktuğ's #FediTips

I used to post feditips when I was on toot.cat. Then I moved to weirder.earth and removed the toot.cat account.

This repository is an archive of the feditips toots. I've extracted these from my data export. They're fairly raw ATM, but when I find the time I'll edit them a bit to cohere outside mastodon. I haven't extracted the replies or errata either, that's for a later time too.
